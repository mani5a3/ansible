AI: Building machines which can think, learn act like human


AI started with 
           --> Rule based system (legacy) EX: Chatbots
		   --> Experts Systems (legacy)
	

Machine learning is modern form of Artificial Intelligence
          --> statistical machine learning
		  --> Deep learning 
                   --> Neural networks
                   --> Generative AI		
				   
Generative AI: Below are core models of Generative AI
         --> LLM Models
		         --> Pretraining
				 --> fine tuning
				 --> prompting
				 --> Reinforcement learning with human feedbacks
		 --> Text to images models
		 --> Text to video models
		 
NLP: Train the model with different languages

Computer vision: That enables machines to see, interpret, and understand visual information from the world—just like humans do, but using algorithms instead of eyes and a brain.
          ex: Camera, screenshots, CCTV, medical scans
